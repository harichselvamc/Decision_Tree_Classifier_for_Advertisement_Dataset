# Decision Tree Classifier for Advertisement Dataset
<br>

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier in R programming language for analyzing an advertisement dataset. 

<hr>

The main goal of this project is to predict the success or failure of an advertisement based on various features present in the dataset.
<br>

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is included in the repository as "advertisement.csv" . It includes relevant information such as the type of advertisement, the platform used, the target audience, and other features that can influence the effectiveness of an advertisement.

main.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It serves as the main entry point for understanding the workflow of the project.
Dependencies
Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

rpart: For building decision trees.
rpart.plot: For visualizing decision trees.
You can install them using the following commands:

R
Copy code
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-advertisement.git
Open and run the main.ipynb notebook in your R environment.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Decision Tree model, and evaluate its performance.
